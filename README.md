On first run your AV might try to scan, sometimes this wil cause problems with connecting after scan is complete. You can manually restart app to fix connecting issues.

When first downloading a mp4 you will probably need to allow in AV/firewall. after allowing app to download one video you can just try downloading again. You only have to do this once if using antivirus.
